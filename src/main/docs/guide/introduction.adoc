Alert :warning: This profile is deprecated as of Grails 4. To keep using it, you must refer to the complete package+version profile, i.e.:
[source, bash]
----
grails create-app myapp --profile=org.grails.profiles:react-webpack:1.0.8
----

This profile is based on the approach described in
this post http://grailsblog.objectcomputing.com/posts/2016/05/28/using-react-with-grails.html[Using React with Grails].
Please read this post for more information.

This profile is a superset of the https://github.com/grails-profiles/webpack[webpack] profile.
It provides a monolithic project structure with React code embedded within the Grails project.

To create an application using the `react-weback` profile you can use the next command:

[source, bash]
----
grails create-app myapp -profile react-weback
----

You can also choose this project when generating your project from the http://start.grails.org[Grails Application Forge], either from the web app or via the API:

[source, bash]
----
curl -O start.grails.org/myapp.zip -d profile=react-webpack
----

Grails Application Forge is a great way to discover the different provided features in the profile.
