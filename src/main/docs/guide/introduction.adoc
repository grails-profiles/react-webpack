This profile is based on the approach described in
this post http://grailsblog.objectcomputing.com/posts/2016/05/28/using-react-with-grails.html[Using React with Grails].
Please read this post for more information.

This profile is a superset of the https://github.com/grails-profiles/webpack[webpack] profile.
It provides a monolithic project structure with React code embedded within the Grails project.

To create an application using the `react-weback` profile you can use the next command:

[source, bash]
----
grails create-app myapp -profile org.grails.profiles:react-webpack:1.0.8
----
(at the time of writing 1.0.8 was the latest version, use whatever version you see fit)
